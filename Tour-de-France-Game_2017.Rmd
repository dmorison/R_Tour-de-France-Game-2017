### Stage results:

```{r, results="asis"}
kable(df_rider_name_results) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striper", "hover", "responsive"))
```
Note: The jersey wearers are the riders that physically wore the respective jersey on the stage. Not the rider who may have won the jersey on the stage - this rider will be wearing the jersey the following stage and then score the points.
